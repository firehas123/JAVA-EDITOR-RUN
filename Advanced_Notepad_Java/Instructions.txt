use cmd and make sure you have JDK 8 set in your environment variable else it will show an error.
in ../Advanced_Notepad_Java/tabbednotepad open cmd
run javac *.java
/* ignore the warnings */
then java TabbedNotepad
/* program will load */
main class is TabbedNotepad.java which has GUI and its components
rest classes are for sub-components and FontAction and ForeBackColorAction files are for styling of the editor
as every editor allows user to customize their editor as well

Requirements
- the class Highlighter in Test.java  is nested class line number 35

- line 138 shows usage of lambda expression in TabbedNotepad.java

- line 842 shows usage of implemeting interface hence polymorphism can be seen here

Additional:

For cmd commands Runtime.exec command is used where javac and java both commands were to be handled separately 
due to windows architecture
